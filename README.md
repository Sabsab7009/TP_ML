# Machine Learning Course Notebooks

This repository contains all the notebooks I worked on during the first semester of my fourth year at ESI as part of the Machine Learning course, in collaboration with my partner, Meryem Batoul Karim. Each notebook is divided into two sections: the first part includes the code for the algorithms, and the second part features tests and our interpretations of the results.
